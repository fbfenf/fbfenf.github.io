> Practice the 4-step learning method based on brain science with the app’s features.

> 🎯 **Recommended Amount**: **3~5 sentences** per day (One Set)

### Step 1. 👂 Context (Input)
**See the forest first.**
1.  **Blind Listening**: Listen to the **3~5 sentences** you will study today **3 times** continuously without looking at the text.
2.  Grasp the overall flow and emotion of the conversation.

### Step 2. 🧐 Drill (Processing)
**Carve each tree perfectly.**
1.  **AI Explain**: Open the first sentence and check unknown words/expressions first.
2.  **Synchro-Reading**: Tap the speaker icon and repeat speaking **at least 10 times** until you match the native speaker's speed.
3.  **Learned**: If it comes out of your mouth smoothly, tap **Learned** and move to the next sentence.
    *(Repeat this process for all 3~5 sentences)*

### Step 3. 🧠 Internalization (Output)
**Return to the forest and make it yours.**
1.  **Blind Shadowing**: Now, try speaking the 3~5 sentences continuously without looking at the text.
2.  **SRS (Review)**: When the **[Review]** notification pops up tomorrow, see you then!

## 🔥 Want to study more? (Stacking)

If you feel **"5 sentences are too few?"**, don't just increase the quantity blindly, but use **'Stacking'**.

1.  Complete **Set 1 (Sentences 1~5)** perfectly. (15 min)
2.  Rest for a while, then study **Set 2 (Sentences 6~10)** with the same routine. (15 min)
3.  Finally, shadow **Set 1 + Set 2 (Sentences 1~10)** continuously.

> ⚠️ **Caution**: Do not try to do 10 sentences at once. Your brain will get tired and lose focus on the later sentences. Make sure to **break it down into 5 sentences, master them**, and then stack them!
