## 🤔 What is an API Key? (Don't worry!)

Think of it as **"your personal ticket"** to use AI services.

- **It's not personal info**: It has nothing to do with your name, phone number, or address.
- **It's safe**: iScript doesn't have a server. Your key is **stored only on your device** and is never shared outside.
